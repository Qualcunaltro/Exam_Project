Unit testing
	- speed_check() in Graphing: check limiting animated graph execution time
	- test input interface and edge cases (float vs int, string vs numbers, very small and very big values)
	
Features
	- saving datasets
	- calculating and graphing Von Neumann entropy
	- write physics background info (adapted from Quantum States notes)
	- create a Configuratio module with constant and parameters to allow users to tinker with them (optional)
	- saving animated graphs (optional)
